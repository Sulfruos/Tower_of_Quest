This is Tower of Quest, a game by Arvind Pillai which is still in development. 
I have mainly created this game to put my Java skills to the test through adding minigames,
utilizing arrays to generate random enemies and encounters, and also using methods to create
a flawless combat system all in text!

In the future, once I have developed the first version of the game, I plan to add to it through
creating more encounters, enemies, and revamping the combat system through introducing more 
"dimensions" of combat (i.e multiple enemies at once, different character classes).
Perhaps I could even use JavaFX or Processing to transcend this game from text based, but then it 
may lose its' indie old-school dungeon runner feel. 

Currently, the game is essentially finished (at least text-based wise)! I just need to make it more user-friendly and crack down on a few bugs which I can learn through playtesting. I look forward to continuing with this project.
