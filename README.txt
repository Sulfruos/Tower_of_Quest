This is Tower of Quest, a game by Arvind Pillai which is still in development. 
I have mainly created this game to put my Java skills to the test through adding minigames,
utilizing arrays to generate random enemies and encounters, and also using methods to create
a flawless combat system all in text!

In the future, once I have developed the first version of the game, I plan to add to it through
creating more encounters, enemies, and revamping the combat system through introducing more 
"dimensions" of combat (i.e status conditions and spells casted using a different resource, mana).
Perhaps I could even use JavaFX or Processing to transcend this game from text based, but then it 
may lose its' indie old-school dungeon runner feel. 

You may be wondering what sample.java is: it is simply a separate file to test Blackjack, which will be in the game.
The enemy in Blackjack will have an expert system intelligence (which of course will only be as sophisticated as a person
can be while playing a gambling game ;>)
