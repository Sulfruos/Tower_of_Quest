This is Tower of Quest, a game by Arvind Pillai which is still in development. 
I have mainly created this game to put my Java skills to the test through adding minigames,
utilizing arrays to generate random enemies and encounters, and also using methods to create
a flawless combat system all in text!

 

Currently, the game is finished (at least text-based wise)! I look forward to continuing with this project through possibly making it graphical using JavaFX, Processing, or even Unity, but for now, be prepared to spend an afternoon on the console version!
